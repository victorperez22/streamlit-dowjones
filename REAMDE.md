# Dow Jones Price Analysis: Assignment 1 - Data Visualization

This is a simple Streamlit app that shows the historical Dow Jones data from a public Google Sheet. The app randomly shows either a line or an area chart and then measures the time it takes for a user to answer a question when he clicks the necessary button.

This is the Project's Structure:

├--streamlit_project.py  #Main Streamlit app file
├--requirements.txt      #Python dependencies
└--README.md             #Project documentation
